# GraceShopper

Our group of Fullstack students created a sample ecommerce website to combine our React, Redux, Sequelize, Express and other web developmen skills. Graceshopper has the functionality for users to sign up for an account, view items, add to cart and checkout in a click of a button.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

Run `npm install`
createdb boilermaker
createdb boilermaker-test

Running `npm run start-dev` will make great things happen!

If you want to run the server and/or `webpack` separately, you can also
`npm run start-server` and `npm run build-client`.

## Running the tests

* By default, running `npm test` will use `boilermaker-test`, while
  regular development uses `boilermaker`
